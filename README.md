# Cat Elevator

A content-agnostic, distributed, pattern-finding web service which facilitates crowd-sourcing analysis and pattern identification in multimedia content sets by enabling the rapid development of heavily collaborative services.

Examples include: tagging videos base on their containing cats; dogs; or both, searching security footage for suspects, translating languages, or locating that tricky son-of-a-bitch Waldo in a large collection of images. Further applications include producing datasets for comparative analysis against predictive algorithms and for training neural nets with redundant human decisions.
